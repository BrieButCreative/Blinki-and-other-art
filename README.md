Thought as a project documentation thingy but decided to take over  
Just some fun coding adventure im on;  
code.py und blinki-code.py are worked on activly by me (Brie), the rest is kinda ded  
Its simple code to create pictures (and possibly animations) on the nxt-Screen  
(animations arent possible rn, but ill prbly optimize it in the future)  
or to create blinkis  
(both are far from finished)  
its just something i have fun with so yeah, enjoy...


To-Do
line is 'straight'  
line differentiation left and right click (once with overwrite (line has definite color or changing))  
~~back a step (Liste bool array)~~      ~~forward a step (after backstep)~~  
color change in blinki  
copy function
~~invert (inverts colors, duh)~~  
a way to make custom lines/shapes and more shapes  
a copy function  
Possibly make blinki-code create blinkis directly (hopefully)  
effizientere speicherung  
Gezieltere bearbeitung (box zum bearbeiten -> Copy und paste abilty?)  
different kinds of opening files (Image/animation)  

UI;  
    * show which mode (filling, line, coloring,...)  
    * choosing file  
    * size interface (for size changes)  
    * help command (nice integration)  
    * and color change interface
