# Informations
Thought as a project documentation thingy but decided to take over  
Just some fun coding adventure im on;  
nxc-code.py und blinki-code.py are worked on activly by me (Brie), the rest is kinda ded  
Its simple code to create pictures (and possibly animations) on the nxt-Screen  
(animations arent possible rn, but ill prbly optimize it in the future)  
or to create blinkis  
(both are far from finished)  
its just something i have fun with so yeah, enjoy...  

nxc-code.py is the code for the nxc-drawer  
blinki-code.py is the code for the blinki-maker  
  
You should use str + F and replace 'C:\\Users\\volke\\Downloads\\vscode_plugin\\vscode_plugin\\BLINKI-AND-OTHER-ART\\bitmap.nxc' with whatever directiory you want the temporary file saved in
